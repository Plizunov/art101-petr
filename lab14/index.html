				 	<p>This lab is designed to revisit the old lab assignments and to correct them accordingly.</p>

				<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>This lab was kind of empty for me because I haven't had any labs that needed resubmitting outside of some extra tasks.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The results of this laba re recorded in the PDF that was submitted for <a href="https://canvas.ucsc.edu/courses/39790/assignments/204001">lab 14</a></p>
