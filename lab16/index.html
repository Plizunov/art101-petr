				<h1>This page was authored by Petr Lizunov for Lab 16 - JSON</h1>
				<p><a href="../index.html">BACK TO DIRECTORY</a></p>
				 	<p>This lab is designed to use AJAX to collect JSON data froma  remote server.</p>

				<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>This lab was the most challenging of all labs so far just because of an introduction of a new concept like JSON, but otherwise it was pretty easy to wrap my head around since it was already based on a concept that we have already explored in this class.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The result of this lab is a random comic from XKCD API that will be shown to you upon pressing this button: <button id="button">Click me!</button></a></p>
