				<h1>This page was authored by Petr Lizunov for Lab 4 - PseudoCoding and Problem-solving</h1>
				<p><a href="../index.html">BACK TO DIRECTORY</a></p>
				 	<p>This lab is intended to develop critical thinking and breakdown of larger tasks into smaller tasks that is essential for programming</p>
				<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>This lab presented little challenge considering that we went over this material during lecture and sections. I am, however, looking forward to trying to use these skills creatively which will definitely be a challenge. </p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Here are my lists presented as both HTML lists and commented JavaScript Code</p>
				<h3>How do you write instructions? - Provided list</h3>
				<p id="bold">=Writing your instructions</p>
				<ul>
					<li>1. Divide the task into baby steps. Each step should have a single action, not several</li>
					<li>2. Start each step with an action word</li>
					<li>3. Follow a logical progression</li>
					<li>4. Choose your words carefully</li>
					<li>5. Use positive actions</li>
					<li>6. Write in second person</li>
					<li>7. Include alternatives</li>
					<li>8. Use graphics where helpful</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>And here is the same list in code format, how it would be commented out in a Java Script document</h3>
